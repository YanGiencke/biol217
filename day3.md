# Genaral sequencing
## Binning
- Clustering contigs
- Two methods:
  -   Refference based
  -   De-Novo
- x

## Basics:
- Gouping by
  -   GC-Content
  -   Tetramer or K-mer frequencies
  -   x


## Analyzing frequency of K-mers
- look at frame of length K 
- count frequency of sequence in frame in DNA
- move frame one nucleotide ...
- capture date in table/matix
- transfer data to graphs

## Analyzing K-mer graphs
- small areas = Ribosomal genes (very conserved genes)
- biger areas = Geneic islands or virus induced DNA

## Analysing coverage
- looking at contigs and their coverage in different probes
  -   simillar changes in coverage suggest two contigs are frome one genome
- looking at a refference genome
  -   allows an estimation abundance

## MAGs quality assessment
- fragmentation
